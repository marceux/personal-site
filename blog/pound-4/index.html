								<p>...needs a blog. </p>

								<p>It’s January 1st, 2010 and registration for Pound 4 has been closed for about 12 or so hours at the time of this writing.  Hype for this tournament has been steadily building since the end of Genesis.  Players from around the world have planned to attend and forums from Smashboards to Gamefaqs to Gamespot and even an obscure Puerto Rican Smash Forum (http://www.smashpr.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1802 ) all are talking about Pound 4.  If you look at the website page for Pound 4 you can see a list of tournament attendees and those that have already registered.  http://pound4registration.weebly.com/bullplayersbull.html.  Big names like Mew2King, Mango, Armada, Amsah, DaShizWhiz, Dr. Peepee, Silent Spectre, etc… </p>

								<p>You can see that Melee has a strong showing of 322 registered players while Brawl has a little more than half of that registered with 186.  Genesis, in July, had more than 250 entrants for both games. </p>

								<p>If this was a litmus test of game popularity, it’s almost as if the players are speaking with their presence and enthusiasm over what might just be the “better” game.  This also applies to the leaders of both metagames. </p>

								<p>Mango’s recent losses to Kage at Revival of Melee 2, and his very close matches with Armada at Genesis, show that Melee has far from stabilized.  There are talks of Ganondorf being a possible Jigglypuff counter, and people are predicting that Armada might just pull 1st or 2nd again, aside from the fact that Peach, Armada’s main character, was thought to never be capable of winning a major tournament less than a year ago.  Let’s also not forget that both players (Kage and Armada) are pulling in victories and making names for themselves despite being from regions outside the U.S. </p>

								<p>It almost seems as if 2009 opened the doors for exploration in Melee.  Credit could go to the hype machine that propelled Genesis to become the successful and eye-opening event that it was; or it could go to the facilitation of recording matches and posting them onto youtube so that anybody can see them and be entertained by commentary, combos, or upsets.  Within a day of Mango’s set vs Kage at Revival of Melee 2, the video broke 1000 views. </p>

								<p>DEHF vs Tyrant at R3 is still hovering around 400 as of this writing. </p>

								<p>Is it the lack of an entertaining commentator?  Is it because the game is much more boring to watch?  Or are we caring less and less about Brawl? </p>

								<p>Press Ctrl+F on the Registered Players page and type in “Oats.”  You’ll see that I signed up for both, because I find both games fun.  Now, take the time to find other players from the West Coast.  Search for our biggest names (excuse the regional bias).  Tyrant, DSF, MikeHAZE, DEHF (Larry Lurr),  Havok, etc...  So exactly how many of those names are actually going? </p>

								<p>Part of this may sound like a rallying call for better regional representation at a tournament that’s faraway and might be too expensive to attend.  Oh yeah, Winter Games Fest (a very successful tournament, that will be organized by someone I have a lot of respect for – Azn_Lep) is the same weekend.  So, people have an excuse not to go to Pound 4, since we have our own regional here in town too.  Let’s ignore the fact that I live in San Diego where Winter Games Fest will be hosted and held.  Let’s ignore the fact that Melee will also be featured at Winter Games Fest and that you don’t see Mango attending it to get that easy guaranteed money… </p>

								<p>Havok was joking with me about our crews matches against East Coast.  The joke was that I would be in the crew along with HugS, DEHF, Havok, and whoever else we can scrounge up.  Well I sure hope Ally doesn’t know Lucas can Zap Jump. </p>

								<p>So, if Pound 4 is not turning out to be this massive Brawl National Event because of the lack of support and attendance from a major region, what is there to look forward to, right?  It’s going to be M2K vs Ally at the end, and that’s what it will be.  Well as Pound 4 approaches, what is there to hype? </p>

								<p>DEHF. Period. </p>

								<p>I hate to put pressure on the guy because he really doesn’t need it, but for taking the arguably “Third Best National Player” and giving him the 6-0 in tourney, and possibly pushing forth an aspect of the metagame many people are very excited to explore, all eyes will mostly be on his matches.  Not only is he one of the few that can juggle high-level Brawl and Melee (he’s on both games’ regional crews), this will be his first time travelling to the East Coast for such an event.  Many doubt he’ll even make it that far, others say he can beat M2K, and with little pro Falco experience, the East Coast might have a reason to be worried.  He’s SoCal’s “Armada”.  He’s our lone little voyager carrying a banner for a region licking its wounds.  He’s taken out Ally, and he’s beaten Dojo.  Is he finally ready to take on M2K after almost previous try has result in a loss?  Who knows.  I assure you though, we’ll be on the edge of our seats watching every match. </p>

								<p>- Oats. </p>

								<p>Note: I was going to write something a little more reflective on the state of the metagame but my fingers took me somewhere else entirely.  Meh. I always write something in white at the bottom of my blogs.  I think. I think it had to be said.</p>
