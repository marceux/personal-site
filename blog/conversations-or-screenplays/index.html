								<p>...and I can't do shit. </p>

								<p>-- </p>

								<p>When I have a conversation with someone, I dig pretty deep.  I grab my shovel and just start breaking at the very base of our wants and ideas. </p>

								<p>Did you know that in almost every single conversation you have with someone, you are attempting to convince them of something?  We are blissfully unaware of how selfish we can be sometimes - the byproduct of being single-minded beings - and that the act of a conversation is just us trying to make sure our ideas are heard and understood. </p>

								<p>So, I was having a conversation, and it was about something that had recently been bugging me, and I just wanted it settled.  I wanted to just end the tension my way, because I am certain my way will bring me the most happiness.  As you can see, I'm pretty selfish. </p>

								<p>Havok told me my way was completely pointless and that in the grand scheme of things (he thinks of the grand scheme; I, in the minutae) it was an insignificant gain.  It didn't accomplish much and it really was kind of selfish. </p>

								<p>I listened to him, understood, presented my point, and I was convinced that I was right.  I moved on. </p>

								<p>-- </p>

								<p>Conversations are like stories.  Set-up the characters, present the story, there is rising action due to conflict, then a climax, and then denouement. </p>

								<p>Ever have a really good conversation and it just feels like every line is adding another thread to this grand epic tale you were sharing with the right one-person audience?  Tangents are different tones or styles, plot-twists, but they make sense, and the story never falters.  I like telling excellent stories.  Excellent stories have good drama. </p>

								<p>When I talk to Hall, Havok, Bone, or some of my favorite conversationalists outside of the Smash Community, it feels all the better when they disagree but they want to reach the same point.  They want to reach the same idea, the same goal, but we have different ways of getting there.  It's these differences but unification of purpose that really highlight the intricacies of building good relations. </p>

								<p>Remember in Rush Hour when Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan (see: Champ) each wanted to get the same bad guy but for different reasons?  And the inherent tension and drama of their differences made for a pretty entertaining movie?  It's like that.  I want to be Jackie, and I want Bone to warn me to never touch a black man's radio without their permission. </p>

								<p>Strong personalities, distinct personalities are the most memorable ones. </p>

								<p>-- </p>

								<p>Sometimes though, I just hate it.  That's drama and good storytelling too though. </p>

								<p>Someone you talk to who is way too thickheaded in their own ways and you absolutely know they're doing it wrong.  Everything they think or sputter is diametrically opposed to your goal or your idea.  That's your villain.  Not your buddy cop. </p>

								<p>That's fine too.  Because you want the villain to be good, you want the villain to be conquered and convinced that they are the villain.  Good villains don't see themselves as villains though.  They just want what they want, and you want what you want. </p>

								<p>The Joker in the Dark Knight is an excellent villain, because he doesn't think to himself, "I'm a bad man, and I'm here to fuck with Batman" he thinks he's committing a grand experiment.  He has a very distinct goal or ambition and all he wants to do is complete it.  Fuck all if its bad or good.  That's unimportant. </p>

								<p>Good villains don't see themselves as bad guys. </p>

								<p>-- </p>

								<p>I know I'm not the bad guy, because I clearly want a specific thing, but to someone else it just doesn't make sense.  It's not significant in the grand scheme of things.  But whose to say their scheme matches mine?</p>
